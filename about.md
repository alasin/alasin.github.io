Hello, I am Anuj, a recent Computer Science graduate from BITS Pilani, India. I love to explore new computing areas, having worked on projects as simple as a single page web-app and as complex as a multiple camera fusion and panorama system. When I'm not working, I spend my time reading tech blogs, playing video games, watching thrillers and solving puzzles.

I have been working as a Computer Vision engineer at Tonbo Imaging since July '15. My experience as an intern here was great, which eventually made me join the firm as a full-time employee.
Currently, I am working on adding cloud removal functionality to <a
href="http://geotrellis.io/">GeoTrellis</a> for my GSoC '15 project. Images taken
from satellites like Landsat often contain clouds and cloud shadows in them
which consequently, obscure the important terrain data. My project deals with
adding automated cloud-removal capability to GeoTrellis, which commonly deals
with large rasters like these images. </p>

If you think I can be of some help or just wanna talk about something interesting, [**Contact me**](/contact).
