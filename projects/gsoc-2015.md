title: "GSoC 2015 - Cloud removal from satellite imagery for GeoTrellis"
permalink: /projects
---

[GeoTrellis](http://geotrellis.io/) is an open-source, scala-based geospatial data processing framework.
Clouds and cloud shadows often obscure parts of images acquired by satellites or other space-borne sensors. However, useful image data could be extracted from other relatively non-cloudy images of the same geographical location that can be used to 'fill' these obscure parts. When combined together with the right algorithms, these images can offer a cloud-free (or nearly cloud-free) view of that area.

This project aimed to enable GeoTrellis to remove clouds from a large set of imagery. Combined with it's power to process large amount of raster data, it would enable users to run this process over any amount of imagery, in a scalable way. Scala was a completely new language for me before the start of the project, but my mentor [Rob](http://www.azavea.com/about-us/staff-profiles/rob-emanuele/), was a great guide throughout the project.

We tested our algorithms on [this](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ompah,+ON,+Canada/@45.0291377,-76.7892811,13630m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cd24d3c2a575b1b:0x13e80edfa856300!8m2!3d45.0081417!4d-76.8357792) geographical location as it's cloudy and snowy here most part of the year.
