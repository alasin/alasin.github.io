**GSoC '14 - KDE Games**

This project was mostly about porting the [KDE Games](https://games.kde.org/) module to the new KDE Frameworks. The motivation behind the project was to keep KDE Games bit rot-free and maintained with respect to the latest libraries, as all the KDE applications were being ported. I specifically chose to work on KDE Games because I really enjoyed them playing on my Kubuntu distribution and had previously contributed to [KBounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBounce), the former being the reason for the latter.
