**GSoC '14 - KF5 port of KDE Games**

This project was mostly about porting the [KDE Games](https://games.kde.org/) module to the new KDE Frameworks. The motivation behind the project was to keep KDE Games bit rot-free and maintained with respect to the latest libraries, as all the KDE applications were being ported. I specifically chose to work on KDE Games because I really enjoyed them playing on my Kubuntu distribution and had previously contributed to [KBounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBounce), the former being the reason for the latter.

**GSoC '15 - Cloud removal from satellite imagery for GeoTrellis**

Clouds and cloud shadows often obscure parts of images acquired by satellites or other space-borne sensors. However, useful image data could be extracted from other relatively non-cloudy images of the same geographical location that can be used to 'fill' these obscure parts. Multiple images can be captured of an area of interest over time, such as Landsat images. When combined together with the right algorithms, these images can offer a cloud-free (or nearly cloud-free) view of that area. GeoTrellis is already great at distributed raster processing on a cluster. If it were enabled with the power to remove clouds from a large set of imagery, it would enable users to run that process over any amount of imagery, in a scalable way.
