title: "GSoC 2014: KDE Games"
---

Hi everyone!

I am Anuj Pahuja, a Computer Science undergraduate from BITS Pilani, India. It is my first GSoC and I can't thank KDE Community enough for accepting me as a student.

For my GSoC project, I'll be porting KDE Games(_libkdegames_ plus three games) to KDE Frameworks 5. _libkdegames_ contains the common code and data for most of the KDE Games. So the porting strategy would be to first port _libkdegames_ and then port some games that would build upon the KF5 libraries and the updated _libkdegames_ package.

As of now, _libkdegames_ has been ported to KF5, free of _KDELibs4Support_. I'll be now working on porting _KBounce_, a puzzle based-arcade game and then test its build against new _libkdegames_.

I'd like to thank **Eike Hein(Sho)**, my mentor, for his constant help along the project and for reminding me to write this blog post! Will keep updating as the project progresses.

Cheers!
